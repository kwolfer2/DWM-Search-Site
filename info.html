                <h2>Dragon Warrior Monsters</h2>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Dragon Warrior Monsters</strong> is a classic <strong>monster-collecting and battling RPG</strong> released in <strong>1998</strong> (localized in <strong>2000</strong>) for the <strong>Nintendo Game Boy</strong>. While often compared to <em>Pokémon</em>, this game carves out its own identity with <strong>deep breeding mechanics, strategic combat, and an expansive fantasy world</strong> rooted in the <em>Dragon Quest</em> universe. Featuring <strong>iconic character and creature designs by Akira Toriyama</strong> and developed by <strong>Enix</strong>, <em>Dragon Warrior Monsters</em> lets players train, breed, and command an army of monsters in their quest to become the ultimate Monster Master.</p>

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">How do I use this site and what makes it work?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>The point of this site is to provide information on the mosnters found in the game, commonly called a <strong>Beastiary</strong>. </p>
                <br>
                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Monster Search</h1>
                <p>This page serves as the primary way to access the raw info on each monster and features a stat projection feature. <strong>Monsters in Dragon Warrior Monsters do not have static assigned stats, they have growth rates.</strong> This means that the stats are any given monster are entirely dependent on a variety of factors that essentially boil down to <strong>Starting Stat Values + (Growth Rates * Current Level) = Current Stat Values</strong></p>
